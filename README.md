# Daily 8 Ball

## What is it?

This app helps you answer important questions and also helps you make urgent decisions, but only once a day! Ask your question, tap and hold the button, and you will find your answer.

## Features

As a practice project in conjuction with The App Brewery's Complete App Development Bootcamp, the basic features that had to be accomplished were:
1. Display a random 8 Ball response when Ask button is pressed

Some additional features I added are:
1. Make UI responsive to different iPhone and iPad models
2. Add basic animations to UI elements
3. Add the UI and functionality for a persistent timer to ensure that the user can only ask one question a day. The progress is updated accurately whether or not the application itself is open. This was done using data storage in UserDefaults.
